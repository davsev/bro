= Virus & Malware Antivirus Scanner =

CWIS Antivirus Security is based on a unique algorithm developed by our team to find malicious code. It has the fullest signatures database. Also, the premium version of CWIS Antivirus contains the extended heuristic security analysis algorithm that allows it to find viruses not only on the website but on the domain as well.

CWIS Antivirus reveals almost every kind of viruses and malicious code that exist today:

* Webshells and backdoor detection (backdoor webshells)
* Javascript malware, trojans and virus detection (JS viruses)
* PHP malware (server malware) and bot spam file detection
* Detection of phishing pages set up by hackers (phishing pages)
* Hack detection (malicious code in .htaccess)
* SQL Malware detection - an unique feature

CWIS Antivirus has some important advantages:

* The fullest viruses database for signature search
* Heuristic / security analysis algorithm
* Extended search range that allows it to find viruses throughout the domain's space, not only throughout the website
* Scanning for viruses in database

= Vulnerabilities Detection =

One of the most important parts of your website security and protection is a well-timed analysis for plugin, CMS and database vulnerabilities. These security vulnerabilities are an easy way for a hacker to crawl into your website. That's why a well-timed diagnosis and update are vital for hardening the protection of the website.

Our security scanner is able to find:

* Vulnerable/insecure scripts
* Plugins and themes vulnerabilities
* SQL, XSS malicious injections
* Adware, spyware and SPAM links

= Adware, Spyware and SPAM Links Detection =

CWIS scanner successfully detects:

* SEO & SPAM links
* Doorway pages (SEO)
* iFrame injections
* Black-hat SEO infections

= Blacklist Monitoring =

CWIS Blacklist Monitoring scanner checks IP addresses and website domains in most popular security blacklists and safe browsing databases. Real-time Blacklists or Blackhole lists - also called DNS-based Blackhole Lists - are lists of IP addresses published through DNS. Often there are listed computers or networks that may spam or consist malware in such lists. Many secure corporate mail servers are configured to reject or flag messages which have been sent from IP addresses listed in one of these security blacklists.

Leading email systems like Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail also use security blacklists to filter emails by addresses. If your network's IP addresses end up in a blacklist, you and your customers can experience problems sending and receiving emails. It can significantly damage your business.

CWIS Blacklist Monitoring scanner will automatically alert you if your website addresses or domains become listed in any of the widely used URL blacklists.

URIBL (or URL Blacklists) are similar to RBLs, except rather than tracking IP addresses they track domain names and website URLs which have been identified as being used for spamming, phishing or spreading viruses.

If your website becomes blacklisted, any reference to your website URL may be blocked, including: 

* referencing your website URL in email; 
* social media or blog posts; 
* or visitors simply will not be able to get to your website.

The Google and Yandex Safe Browsing security databases include lists of websites that may be dangerous to visitors because they are suspected of phishing scams or spreading viruses.

= Malware Removal Tool, Powerful & Easy To Use =

The CWIS Antivirus Security Scanner will not only help you find all of the viruses and malicious code on your web site but we will also help you remove this malware easily. Our built-in file viewer and editor is an easy security tool to remove the infected file code or its part depending on the type of infection. The cleaning process is very simple and requires no special training.

* Twice a day, daily, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly scan frequency
